Mastodon is a free, decentralized and open source social network developed as an alternative to centralized commercial platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Mastodon is part of the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).

We run our own Mastodon instance, accessible under the name "[systemli.social](https://systemli.social)". Due to our [self-image](https://www.systemli.org/en/about-us/) and the [primary purpose of our instance](https://systemli.social/about), registration is currently closed. However, we would like to encourage friends of the collective, as well as political groups, to [contact us](https://www.systemli.org/en/contact/) for access.
