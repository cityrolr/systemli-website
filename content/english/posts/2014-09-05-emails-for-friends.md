We now offer a [tool for registering and administrating your email-account](https://users.systemli.org). 
The registration works with invitation-codes and every existing account receives three invitation-codes 7 day after 
registering.

You can invite your friends to create a data-protecting email-account with systemli.org by passing on one of your codes.
Furthermore, you can change the password of your email-account with this tool. We have introduced a password-policy to 
ensure that no-one chooses a password that is easy to guess.

Adding to the launch of the invitation-system, we did some improvements in our email-service. You can now also access 
your emails of a different provider. For example: You don't want to use your Googlemail-account anymore? No problem, 
[just get the mails via your systemli.org-account](https://mail.systemli.org/?_task=settings&_action=plugin.getmail). 
If you work from different computers and want to sort and filter the emails, 
[we would recommend the server filtering and sorting of emails directly on our server](https://mail.systemli.org/?_task=settings&_action=plugin.managesieve). 
Especially when using this in [combination with aliases]({{< ref "2014-06-30-monitor-your-user-data.md" >}}) 
there are simple solutions to managing a large amount of emails.

In the future we would like to develop the administration tool further. This includes the possibility to restore a 
forgotten password, to contact us and much more.
