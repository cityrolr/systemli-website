We copied a bit from our friends at [Riseup](https://riseup.net/) and improved our 
[pad service](https://pad.systemli.org).

When creating new pads, there's now three options for the expiry time that you can choose from. For ephemeral pads you 
choose "1 Tag" (1 day), the default stays "30 Tage" (30 days) and for long-lasting projects, there's "1 Jahr" (1 year).
