For a while now, we have started to give services we offer their own design, or at least customize them so that they 
are easier to recognize as a systemli.org service. We started with [Jitsi Meet]({{< ref "meet" >}}) and 
[Nextcloud]({{< ref "cloud" >}}). Now our website follows with a brand new design.

[For almost eight years]({{< ref "2013-09-14-Fresh-colours-on-systemli.org.md" >}}), little to nothing has happened to 
our website in terms of design. Since then, however, a few things have changed for us and in the world: We offer many 
more [services]({{< ref "service" >}}), use the [Ticker]({{< ref "ticker" >}}) to 
[inform about maintenance work](https://updates.systemli.org/) and 
[certificates no longer have to be checked manually]({{< ref "2017-10-18-Lets-Encrypt.md" >}}).

With the new design we especially want to put our services and status updates in the foreground. We would like to thank 
especially [Gegenfeuer](https://www.gegenfeuer.net/) and batabana for the creation of the design, the realization and 
the many big and small wishes during the implementation.

With the new website, we also changed the underlying tooling. We no longer use Jekyll to generate the website, but 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and instead of Bootstrap as the CSS framework, we use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
