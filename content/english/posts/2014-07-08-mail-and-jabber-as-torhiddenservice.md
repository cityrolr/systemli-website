From now on we offer **mail.systemli.org** and **jabber.systemli.org** as 
[Tor Hidden Service](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en).

This enables our users to set up a hidden connection to our services that is channeled through the Tor network.

We run these installations as a test first and would be happy to get some [feedback]({{< ref "contact" >}}) about it 
from you.
