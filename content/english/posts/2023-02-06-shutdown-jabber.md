For a long time, Jabber/XMPP was an important platform for many for encrypted communication without monitoring. Today, it falls far behind other encrypted messengers in many respects, and self-evident features like encrypted group chats or standard encryption are only partially or clumsily implemented by many client apps. As a result, secure use of the service is not easy for many.

On the other hand, there exist secure and userfriendly alternatives to Jabber with platforms like Signal messenger or the [Matrix service hosted by us](https://www.systemli.org/en/service/matrix/).

We have therefore decided to shut down jabber.systemli.org on 08/31/2023. Registration of new accounts will be disabled from 03/31/2023.
