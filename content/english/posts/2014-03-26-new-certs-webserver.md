In the last days we provided new certificates for [www.systemli.org]({{< ref "_index.md" >}}), 
[pad.systemli.org](https://pad.systemli.org) and all sub-domains of [tem.li](https://tem.li). These were signed by the 
Gandi certification body. This certification body is integrated in all common browsers and only gives warning in the 
case of SSL errors.

As always, the fingerprints can be found on the right-hand side of the homepage.
