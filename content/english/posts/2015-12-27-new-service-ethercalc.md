The last couple of years users expressed the wish for a software, where multiple users could work on a spreadsheet 
together. After a long search and the attempt to teach our pad software to create charts, we found a suitable software: 
[Ethercalc](https://ethercalc.net/)

We´ve had positive experience using [Pad-Service](https://pad.systemli.org) and we´d like to follow up on that with 
[Calc-Service](https://calc.systemli.org).

## Features

- work on a spreadsheet together
- a lot of common spreadsheet functions (sum, average...)
- Import of spreadsheet documents

**Please be aware that all spreadsheet documents will be deleted 30 days after last processing it!**

Out thanks goes out to the developers at [Ethercalc](https://ethercalc.net/), ypu can find their software in their 
[Github Repository](https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc)

We published a [Ansible-Role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/detail#/role/6657), with which it should be possible for you 
to create an Ethercalc-Instance. You can find it at the associated 
[Github-Repository](https://github.com/systemli/ansible-ethercalc)
